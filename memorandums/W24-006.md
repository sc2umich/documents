Title: A report on Informationals
---
In the first few weeks of the winter 2024 semester, we held 3 informational sessions. The first we held on zoom (1-16-24), the second was held on north campus(1-18-24), and the last was held simultaneously on zoom and central campus(1-24-24). The attendance of each is listed now

| Informational|Location|Attendance|
|-|-|-|
|1|Zoom|1|
|2|North Campus|4|
|3|Zoom and Central Campus|2|

We may have not attracted large crowds, but I think the ones who came were very interested in the club.

If the club wishes to increase attendance for future informationals, the outreach committee suggests improving advertising scale, mediums, and timeline, allowing the scientific computing student club to occupy more mental real estate.
