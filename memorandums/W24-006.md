Title: Creating a github repository and wiki for official club documents
---
I propose that a joint team of the outreach, project, and website committees along with the secretary-treasurer create a github repository under the SC2 account that stores all official documents related to the club. This would include our constitution, informational docments, such as descriptions of projects, any legislation text such as this, and any other documents that would be usefull for club members to see. At any given time, only club officers would have the ability to modify this repository, but club members would always be able to review it. All documents would be converted into markdown syntax because this is the format for github wikis. This would also provide a platform for members of the executive committee to publish legislative text. Hyperlinks could also be used given this format, allowing us to access documents more easily.
