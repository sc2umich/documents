Title: A report on advertising strategies
---
The club will need to advertise events and meetings to the student body frequently during its operations. The following mediums have been used for previous advertisements

- flyers
- emails to students expressing interest in the club or MICDE

To help improve our advertisements in the future, we will investigate extending to the following mediums

- Mediums provided by the Student Organization Resource Center

Based on previous advertising attempts with flyers, the Outreach committee believes a more structured advertising approach would reduce the amount of work required to disperse meeting times and dates. From this, The outreach committee plans to take the following action:

- Compile 15 locations on both central campus and north campus to hang flyers

Finally, we will implement these advertising strategies for each type of event

- Monthly meetings: Emails to our mailing list (one at two weeks out, and one at the beginning of the week the meeting is in)

- Semester meeting schedule: emails to our mailing list (once per semester once it is decided)

- Advertise to for other events: As decided by organizer
