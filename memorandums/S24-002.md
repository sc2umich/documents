Title: Digital Advertising Strategies for Outreach
---

As the Scientific Computing Student Club (SC2) continues to grow and organize more events, a robust, environmentally friendly, and effective advertising strategy is necessary. The Outreach Committee is committed to transitioning towards exclusively digital advertisement to reduce waste and streamline communication. Below we outline the revised advertising methods and responsibilities.

## Current Digital Advertising Platforms

The club currently utilizes the following digital channels:

- The Maize Page is used to advertise coffee hours and general meetings
- Email communications via our mailing list, focusing on general meetings

## Revised Digital Advertising Strategies

### Social Media Outreach

Content such as event times, locations, meeting content, and food availability for general meetings will be posted on our social media. A content calendar will be developed, and the Outreach Committee will be in charge of content creation and postings.

### Email Communications

While we currently lack the technology for advanced email segmentation, it is recognized as an aspiration for future communications to tailor content to specific subgroups within the mailing list.

### Club Website Updates

Event information will be manually updated by the Outreach Committee to ensure timeliness and accuracy. Any suggestions for structural updates to the website should be directed to the Website Committee.

### University "Happenings"

Events posted to "Happening at the University" will include a [SC2] tag to facilitate identification by interested students. We welcome suggestions for making our listings more effective on this platform.

### Partnerships and Extended Outreach

Relationships with the Student Organization Resource Center (SORC) and other clubs may be leveraged for broader club promotion, and while not strictly for event advertising, such partnerships can enhance overall visibility for SC2.

## Planned Actions

- The Outreach Committee will develop a structured content calendar for social media posts and email reminders.
- To better showcase our events, we will maintain a proactive approach to updating our digital platforms, with a focus on the accuracy of the information provided.
- Implementing effective tagging strategies, such as [SC2], on "Happening at the University" for greater event visibility.
- We will explore opportunities for establishing partnerships with SORC and related organizations to enhance the clubâ€™s general promotion.
- Feedback and ideas for improved digital advertising are encouraged and can be shared with the Outreach Committee.

By refining our digital advertising strategies as outlined above, the SC2 aims to increase engagement, minimize environmental impact, and maintain clear and consistent communication with our audience.
