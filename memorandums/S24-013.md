Title: Coffee Hour, Tabs, and PCards
---

## Coffee Hour Payment

A variety of payment methods exist for student organizations. Possibly one of the more general ones is reimbursement. However, this method is very cumbersome (but thorough) because purchases have to be approved by someone other than the purchaser and the reimbursement method is checks. for large purchases, the encumbrance is fine, but for smaller, frequent expenses, such as those assocaited with coffee hour, it is less fine. We are looking into two other payment methods:

### Pcards:

Pcards are "credit cards" associated with a short code. These are not usually given to student organizations, but they can be issued through SSO partnerships per the SOAS handbook Section 12.9. We would have to fill out a "Sponsored Student Organization PCard Agreement" This would make coffee hour payments much simpler


### A tab with M36:

We have spoken with one of the hosts of our coffee hour. They said they would be able to set up a tab for us to charge to. In this way, the coffee shop can be set up as a vendor and bill us directly. However, this only works for our central campus location. Our north campus location, mujo cafe, would need a different system.
