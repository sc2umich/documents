There are 3 main ways to purchase something using Club funds:
- Using a short code
- Getting reimbursed
- Using M-marketsite


Short code is good if the vendor accepts it as a form of payment at checkout. these would be vendors that do business with the university so often that they can just charge the university directly. Cottage Inn pizza is a good example. 

M-marketsite is good for ordering supplies that are set up to accept a short code, but dont have a good way to input that code when you check out by yourself. Staples is a good example of this. Staples has an account with the univeristy, but we cannot use our shortcode to buy things directly from them. 

Reimbursement should be the last option used because it is the most tedious and slow. You must keep reciepts and get another authorized signer to submit your report (ideally the treasurer secretary). 

Steps to use M-marketsite

1. go to marketsite through wolverine access
2. put whatever you need in a cart
3. select a delivery address(it can be your own office or the MICDE office)
4. Assign Esther Haseli to charge the order to our account
