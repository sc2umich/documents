Title: Replacement of Website Committee Chair
---
Our Website Committee Chair is resigning. Per our constitution, we have two options to proceed. They can remain in the position for one month while we prepare for an election for their position, or we can appoint someone to the position temporarily until we can hold an election. I propose that I hold the position until we can hold an election in our first september meeting. Holding an election early before our main election can give us practice. Additionally, We can advertise the position at our tabling events and informational.

However, one part of the constitution might cause us difficulties. For the vote to count, we have to have at least half of our members vote ([constitution](../constitution/w24.md#section-132c-quorum)). Since we limited our membership to those on the maize page, this results in 42 members. One thing we may need to do is reach out to each member to see if they wish to remain in the club or if they plan on voting.

AMENDED: We will check membership before the vote is counted. Only members who attend the general meeting in september will be elligible to vote since they attended a meeting this semester. Paavai will remain as the current chair until the meeting.
