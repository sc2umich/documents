Title: Acquisition of Dedicated Equipment for General Meetings
---

Recognizing the necessity for high-quality technological support for our general meetings and the challenges faced with the reliance on personal equipment, it is proposed to allocate funds for the purchase of dedicated equipment. 

Whereas the effective execution of general meetings is crucial for the engagement and satisfaction of club members; and

Whereas the recent poor quality of meeting recordings due to inadequate hardware has been identified; and

Whereas the continuity and professionalism of our meetings can be significantly bolstered by the availability of equipment solely dedicated to this purpose;

Now, therefore, be it resolved that the club shall invest in equipment that includes, but is not limited to, the following items:

1. **Inexpensive Laptop**: To reliably host and manage Zoom meetings, present materials, and coordinate with remote participants.

2. **High-Quality Microphone**: To ensure clear audio capture for both presenters and participants, improving the experience of in-person and virtual attendees.

3. **Recording Software Licenses**: To secure reliable and high-quality recording and streaming capabilities, allowing for post-meeting uploads and archiving.

4. **Additional Equipment**: Consideration for peripheral devices such as a webcam, speakers, and other materials that may enhance the meeting experience.

5. **Storage and Transportation**: Secure storage solutions for the equipment when not in use and safe, easily transportable packaging for transporting the equipment to and from meeting locations.

6. **Routine Maintenance**: Establish a maintenance and updating schedule for the equipment to ensure its longevity and performance quality.

7. **Equipment Management**: The equipment can be stored in the MICDE office when it is not checked out by an officer. Officers should only check the equipment out when they are to preside over a board or general meeting. The equipment can remain checked out for as long as the member is presiding over meetings.

8. **Funding Sources**: This equipement can be funded by the general meetings and workshop funds. Purchases related to this resolution can allocate money from other budgets are repay them in future fiscal cycles.

By implementing this resolution, the club aims to:

- Improve the overall quality of general meeting presentations and recordings.
- Minimize technical issues that arise from the dependency on personal devices.
- Provide a consistent and professional setup for all meetings.
- Enhance accessibility and inclusivity for remote members who rely on digital meeting content.

The initial cost of this investment will be evaluated against the current club budget, and a detailed budget proposal will be prepared. The purchase will be made with an eye towards cost-effectiveness while fulfilling all requirements for quality and functionality.

The approval and execution of this expenditure will be subject to a majority vote by the club members during the next general meeting. Further discussion and feedback are encouraged prior to the meeting.
