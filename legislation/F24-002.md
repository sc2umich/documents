Title: Collaboration with Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) Seminar Group
---

In recognition of the complementary aims and mutual benefits that a partnership with the Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) seminar group can bring to both organizations, it is proposed that SC2 formally collaborate with SciML on various fronts.

Whereas SciML is a new and dynamic group that hosts bi-weekly seminars featuring field experts who present cutting-edge research in scientific machine learning; and

Whereas SC2, as an official university club, has special privileges such as room reservations and promotional opportunities; and

Whereas MICDE, our parent organization, wants both organizations to succeed to further its own objectives and is considering providing additional funding to support such collaborative endeavors;

Now, therefore, be it resolved that SC2 establishes a formal collaboration with the SciML seminar group under the following terms:

1. **Cross Promotion**: SC2 and SciML will actively promote each other’s events and activities through their respective communication channels, including email, and digital notices.
   
   - SC2 will include SciML seminar event details on their maize page, which they use to advertise their events. This is a good avenue for advertisements since  SciML will prepare all necessary event details (location, time, description, rsvp questions, etc.) and will be responsible for creating the events. For this purpose, a SciML representative position will be added to the SC2 organization
   - SciML can promote SC2 to their audience if the overlap in subject matter seems relevant. An example overlap could be to remind the audience of a machine learning workshop if one is planned.
2. **Resource Sharing**:
   
   - SC2 will allow SciML to utilize its club resources, such as reserving rooms for their bi-weekly seminars, leveraging SC2’s established privileges as a recognized student organization.
   - SciML will have access to our advertisement platforms to publicize their seminars, including our Maize Page, website, and physical/digital flyers within campus policies.
   
3. **Content Contribution**:
   
   - SciML can occasionally provide content for SC2 general meetings. This can include workshops, lectures, or joint projects focusing on scientific machine learning topics.
      - projects that may be lead by SciML could be efforts to reproduce models introduced in seminars
      - workshops and lectures could teach fundamental concepts of SciML to their audiences to make the advanced seminars more understandable.
   - Additionally, SciML could lead planning and inviting of experts to present at SC2 meetings to help SC2 provide content for their members
   
4. **Funding Support**: 
   
   - SC2 may seek additional funding from MICDE or to support the SciML seminar group. This financial assistance can be directed toward special events, or promotional activities, such as for purchasing digital advertisement through SORC.

5. **Coordination and Governance**: 
   
   - The SC2 president will be appointed to maintain regular communication with SciML representatives, ensuring smooth collaboration and alignment of activities.
   - Joint meetings between SC2 and SciML leadership will be held once a semester to review the partnership's progress, discuss upcoming events, and identify new opportunities for collaboration.

By establishing this partnership, SC2 and SciML aim to enhance the educational experiences of their members, broaden their reach, and foster a vibrant community of students and professionals passionate about scientific computing and machine learning.

This proposal is open for discussion and will be subject to approval by a member vote at the next general meeting. All feedback and suggestions are welcome to ensure that this collaboration benefits both organizations and their members effectively.
