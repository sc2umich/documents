Title: Approval of Winter Semester Club Meeting Schedule
---
Informationals are over, and it is time to start planning for club meetings. Sticking to the once-a-month plan, we can likley fit three club meetings in this semester. I propose the following dates and locations for club meetings.

- February 13th 6:00 P.M.-7:00P.M. GGBL 2147
- March 12th 6:00 P.M.-7:00P.M. Mason Hall 3330
- April 16th 6:00 P.M.-7:00P.M. GGBL 2147

After this last club meeting, we will decide the schedule for potential summer meetings in our next board meeting.
