Title: Approval of Officer Votes
---

Our November vote to elect officers did not reach 50% of active membership. Given that the only contested position had unanimous votes, I move that we validate the election results and appoint the following people to these elected positions:
- President: Jacob Pavelka
- Vice President: Tim Thompson (6-0 votes against Umar)
- Sectretary-Treasurer: Jacob Pavelka
- Workshop Chair: Umar Farooq
- Website Chair: Brandon Hardy
- Members-at-Large:
   - Sam Cochran
   - John Sayut
   - Umar Farooq
