Title: Establishment of Training Program for Newly Elected Officers
---

In recognition of the importance of a seamless transition and sustained effectiveness in the governance of the Scientific Computing Student Club (SC2), a structured training program for newly elected officers is proposed. This training program will also help build a body of knowledge, supplemental to our constitution, related to the clubs operation and goals.

Whereas the success of the club is highly dependent on the knowledge, preparedness, and leadership abilities of its officers; and

Whereas comprehensive understanding of the clubâ€™s programs, activities, and operational processes is essential for new officers to execute their roles effectively; and

Whereas the future officers need to be well-acquainted with the roles and responsibilities of their colleagues to foster collaboration and understanding within the executive team;

Now, therefore, be it resolved that a mandatory training program for all newly elected officers of SC2 be instituted, with the following conditions:

1. **Training Program Development**: A training program will be developed by current officers and our advisor to cover essential knowledge areas including but not limited to:
   - An overview of each program and event hosted by the club.
   - Detailed explanation of the roles and responsibilities of all officer positions.
   - Administrative procedures, including club financial policies, meeting structures, and partnership protocols.
   - Resources available to officers, including contacts, existing documents, and support systems.

2. **Training Duration and Requirements**: The training program will consist of a single canvas course which should take no more than an hour to complete. The training should be completed over a period not exceeding one month after the election of new officers in November.

3. **Completion Before Term Start**: It shall be mandatory for all newly elected officers to successfully complete the training program prior to the commencement of their term in January. Failure to complete the training is grounds for removal from the officer position

4. **Acknowledgment of Completion**: Each officer shall receive a certificate of completion, which serves as a formal acknowledgement that they are prepared to undertake their official duties.

5. **Regular Updates**: To ensure the program remains current and effective, the training material will be reviewed and updated annually prior to the election period.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**: A feedback system will be established, enabling incoming officers to share their training experience and suggest improvements.

By adopting this legislation, SC2 seeks to maintain continuity and enhance leadership skills within the club, resulting in better service to our members and a more robust community overall. This training program will also ensure that our new officers are empowered to contribute meaningfully and effectively from the very start of their tenure.
