Title: Obtaining an official count of members
---
Informationals are over and we now need to move on to normal club business. Before we can do anything as a club, however, we need to be officially recognized. This requires, among other things, at least 10 members. Including the six of us and the 7 people who attended the information, we would have enough. However, we never officially asked anyone in those meetings if they wanted to be apart of the club. 

One option is to send out an email to all those interested and ask for their confirmation to be a member of the club. They could then become "Active Members", and be elligible to submit projects and workshops. Another option is to add everyone who is on the mailing list as an active member. I think this would be fine because there is a field on the form they filled out asking for their consent to become a member, but it is a little problematic because many likely filled out the form last semester or even earlier.

I propose that we take the latter option but only include people who filled out the "join" from around the beginning of the fall semester onward.
