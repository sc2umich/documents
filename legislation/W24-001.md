Title: Approval of Winter Semester Board Meeting Schedule
---
After the informationals we had, it is time for us to slow down our board meeting schedule. We have the club mostly set up, and we can reserve the time on future monthly board meetings to focus on well though out acts and amendmets to the constitution. The future board meetings will be a place for committee chairs to update the executive committee on progress and for us to vote on actions and amenmdents that have been reviewed before the meeting. As such I propose we adopt the following meeting schedule:

- January 31st 5:30 P.M.-6:30P.M.
- February 21st 5:30 P.M.-6:30P.M.
- March 20th 5:30 P.M.-6:30P.M.
- April 17th 5:30 P.M.-6:30P.M.

Once we reach the last meeting of this schedule, we will schedule further meetings for the summer.
