Title: Extending Duration of General Meetings
---

Given our club's dedication to providing educational and enriching experiences for members and the previous workshops indicating that our workshops require more time, it is proposed that we extend the duration of general meetings.

Whereas general meetings are currently limited to one hour, which has consistently proven insufficient for thorough discussions, workshops, and Q&A sessions; and

Whereas our commitment is to offer high-quality, comprehensive workshops that allow for full presentations without rushing, which is beneficial to both presenters and attendees; and

Whereas an extension would permit more relaxed networking time, fostering better community and stronger relationships among members;

Now, therefore, be it resolved that general meetings of the Scientific Computing Student Club should be extended by 30 minutes to a total of one and a half hours.

The proposed extension aims to:

1. Ensure workshops can be presented in full without time constraints impeding the depth or quality of content.

2. Provide adequate time for a thorough Q&A session following the workshop, allowing members to delve deeper into the subject matter.

3. Encourage informal discussions and networking before or after the official agenda, strengthening our club community and enabling members to discuss collaborative projects or club initiatives.

4. Allow for unexpected delays or technical issues without compromising the schedule of the meeting agenda.

Implementation of the proposed timing structure:

- The new meeting duration would be effective starting in the fall.
- An updated schedule will be communicated to all members via our existing digital platforms including email, Maize Page, and the club's main website.
- Feedback and experiences with the new meeting length will be evaluated after a trial period of the fall semester to ensure that the needs of our members are being met and to make any necessary adjustments. We want to make sure the meetings aren't too long.

It is encouraged that all members consider this proposal and provide their input during the next general meeting when this proposition will be brought to a vote. Your participation in this decision-making process is highly valued and critical to the continued success and growth of the Scientific Computing Student Club.
