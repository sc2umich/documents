Title: Approval of Summer Semester Club Meeting Schedule
---
Over the summer, we can continue our passive activities, like club projects, but we will have to decide whether to continue our planned events, like club meetings. I propose we continue our normal meeting schedule in the summer.

- May 21st 3:00 P.M.-4:00P.M. Location TBD
- June 18th 3:00 P.M.-4:00P.M. Location TBD
- July 16th 3:00 P.M.-4:00P.M. Location TBD
- August 13st 3:00 P.M.-4:00P.M. Location TBD

After this last club meeting, we will decide the schedule for fall meetings in our next board meeting.
