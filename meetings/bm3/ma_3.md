## WS: Workshops
### Budget Workshop

Lets use the remaining time we have in the schedule meeting to develop a budget. Initially, let committee chair propose a budget for their committee and let anyone propose another budget category. Then, we can balance the budget and get approval from the secretary treasurer.

Here are some ideas for budgets

#### Project Committee
- computing resources
- funds for project management (project website, github membership)

#### Outreach Committee
- funds for outreach events
- funds for advertising

#### Workshop Committee
- funds for compensating presenters?
- funds for reserving presentation spaces
- funds for workshop management (workshop website)

#### Website Committee
- funds for computing infrastructure (server,domain name, etc.)
- funds for SaaS

#### Event/Social Committee
- Funds for events
- Funds for competition teams

#### Other funds
- merch
- meeting food?
- administrative costs (registration?)
