## Ideas for club activites:
- Meetings: Several of you mentioned this club should be a place for people interested in scientific computing to meet. I agree! I think we should have monthly meetings to get together in-person. In these meetings, we can make any announcements related to the club, have workshops, and propose projects to work on collaboratively. approved

- Projects: I think this club needs to have a central activity everyone can work on. For this, i think the club should take on two or three scientific computing projects at a time. This way, we can practice our collaboration and scientific computing skills. We can host the projects on the scientific computing club github repository, and the vice president can be in charge of managing the repository. I have some projects in mind as an example: we could develop a website to showcase our projects/ facilitate group activities, we could develop a library for performing automatic differentiation, an algorithm crucial to deep learning, or even start to develop our own finite element simulation suite. The goal of these projects is not to be competitive in the scientific computing ecosystem, but rather to improve our skills and familiarity with scientific computing. To start a project, anybody who is a member can put together a proposal to be presented at the monthly meeting. If the proposal is accepted and dont have too many projects, we can begin that project, and the person who proposed it will be in charge of leading the project. secure hpc recources for incentive. approved.

- Workshops: i believe we have all developed a particular set of skills when it comes to scientific computing, and sharing those skills with one another could be a benefit of this club. I think the bulk of our monthly meetings could be centered around a 30 min workshop hosted by a member of the club. Anyone could propose a workshop, and they would then be added to the queue of scheduled workshops. Only having meetings once a month should make sure we always have someone who wants to host a workshop, but if we end up having more, then we can increase our meeting frequency. (Professors could host workshops too). fundamentals presentations (guage audience familiarity). maybe make a template in the future. approved.

- Outreach: our club needs a way to connect with new members. One idea I had was a coffee shop office hours, were someone could come and ask any question related to scientific computing and we could try our best to answer. Even if we couldn't answer their question, we could buy them a coffee for their time. This would expose people to the club and increase membership. 

slack helping forum: approved

- Events: someone proposed  participating in hackathons, and i love this idea. I have never been a part of one, but i have always wanted to.  they are always fascinating to spectate. Even if we dont get to participate in many. Perhaps we could open our own as another way of outreach. (include modeling and data challenges) : approved

# Ideas for Officer Responsibilities
- President: Lead Officers and Club

- VP: Manage Github and Projects

- Sec/Tres: Budget, meeting room management/club room

- Executive Committee: Event management/ workshop managment/ student prepresentation and change name

- Website Committee: Develop Website 

# Ideas for Schedule and Format
- once a month. next week and every other week until we decide to stop
- come to decisions based on a vote (parlimentary proceedure)

# Notes
- club room

- cluster allocation
