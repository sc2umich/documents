# Detailed Version

This club provides a community for those interested in computer simulations, high-performance computing, or other software related to science. We are mainly focused on four areas: projects, workshops and presentations, events, and community.

For club projects, any member can submit a scientific computing project of interest to them. Then, they manage the project and can lead others in contributing to the project or learning more about the subject material. We emphasize the professional development available from club projects. By leading a project, you have the opportunity to lead 10-20 people, and to lead effectively, you must learn the subject material well enough to teach it to others.

The workshops and presentations focus of our club also encourages contribution from the club body. Any member can submit a workshop or presentation, and then, they can teach the club a new skill using a workshop or introduce new ideas through a presentation. This aspect of our club can be used by our members to improve their presentation skills, increase their knowledge of a particular subject, or practice a presentation for an important event. Additionally, we invite professors and other experts in scientific computing to present their research, allowing our members to connect to the larger scientific computing community.

We host various internal events as a club, such as social and outreach events, but we are also interested in participating in many external events, such as hackathons and data challenges. Participating in these events individually can be challenging since they can demand hours or days of your time or even require registration fees. We provide the resources to make this process easier. We set up a system allowing you to create competition teams open to the club and request funding for registration fees, making it easier to participate in these events and gain the credentials associated with them.

Besides the activities we list above, we also want to provide a space for those interested in scientific computing to meet one another, share experiences, and possibly collaborate.

Finally, This club has a robust leadership structure that allows many members to participate in leading the club to the degree that is suitable to them. The leadership is organized into six committees: an Executive Committee and five task-based committees. The Executive Committee can have at least 9 positions, and the task-based committees are composed of four members. Graduate student members may be elected to positions on the Executive Committee, and any club member may be nominated to a position on the task-based committees by the respective committee chair.
